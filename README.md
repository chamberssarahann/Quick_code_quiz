# Quick Code Quiz

## Description

I built this to explore javascript more intimately, and get familiar with local storage. I wanted to challenge myself to make a clean, simple, but interactive quiz that is both informational and challenging, given the time element. I learned a lot about functions and methods, and I learned I need a lot more time with these languages to make it elegent and not just functional. There's a lot of code that repeats, but that was the only way I could wrap my brain around executing this many interdepentant functions. I hope to return and refactor it soon, as well as add a CSS framework.
